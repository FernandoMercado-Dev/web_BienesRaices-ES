# Web Bienes Ra√≠ces

## Introduction
This is a practice project designed to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS with SASS, and JavaScript, utilizing Gulp to compile SASS and optimize image formats. The project uses dev dependencies in an npm environment and manages additional libraries with Composer. Additionally, it incorporates PHP and SQL to handle user information.

The goal of this project is to develop a real estate website featuring a logo and navigation bar within a hero section at the top of the page. Below that, the website includes various sections, such as About Us, Property Ads for Sale, a graphic section with a contact button, and a blog with testimonials. Each section has its own dedicated page with detailed information.

The project follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure a better code structure, improved scalability, and maintainability.

Additionally, the website provides functionality for managing property ads and sellers, allowing admin users to create, modify, and delete ads and seller information using database CRUD operations.
