# Web Bienes Raíces

## Introduction
This is a practice project to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS with SASS, and JavaScript, using Gulp to compile SASS and optimize image formats, along with PHP and SQL to manage user information.

The goal of this project is to create a real estate website featuring a logo and navigation bar within a hero section at the top of the page. Below that, various sections will be included, such as About Us, Property ads for Sale, a graphic with a contact button, and a blog with testimonials. Each section will have its own dedicated page with detailed information.

Additionally, the website offers functionality for managing property ads—allowing users to create, modify, and delete ads—powered.
